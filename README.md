# Friendly Collaboration Party

This repository is for planning a party to learn GitHub and more! Because what better way to spend my birthday?

And also because working together makes me go WOW.

## About
This is some text about my project.
Parties are great right? Let me tell you how mine will be the very best. THE VERY BEST!

## Team
So far my team is small - just 1 person, but I'm willing to work with you!
I'd really like for you to bring a few more people along to join in.

## Setup & Requirements
This project requires a computer and internet.
We need puppies and balloons!!!
